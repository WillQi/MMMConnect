For my assignment I have the additional challenge of extending the tutorial video.

+ MVC structure
    + Models
    + Views
    + Controllers
+ Post a message without leaving the page
    + Post count is changed as well.
+ Made the register/login errors pretty.
+ Used PDO instead of mysqli and avoided sql injection attacks
+ Used BCRYPT instead of md5 as md5 hashes are crackable via dictionary attacks.
+ Added 404 page
+ No more annoying .php at the end of any file.
+ Timestamps automatically change.
+ Login via username

Part 2
+ Everything related to profile messages is basically ajax.
+ You can edit messages.
+ Deleting posts no longer refreshes the page.
+ Conversations now fetch messages automatically.
+ Sends error if you upload an invalid file.

Part 3
+ AJAX IS LITERALLY COOL OK.
+ Markdown, but like there's a lot of vulnerability with it right now. @-@
